// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let myArray : string[] = [`DubaI`, `Burj Khalifa`, `Palm Jumeirah`, `Dubai Frame`];


console.log(`things I love about`, myArray[0], );

myArray.forEach(Element => {
    console.log(Element);
});
